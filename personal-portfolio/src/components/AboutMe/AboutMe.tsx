              I'm a passionate programmer, driven by the understanding and
              reflection on contemporary challenges, as well as by the planning
              and construction of efficient algorithms to solve them.
            </li>

              I began my journey in programming at the age of 16, when I wrote
              my first "Hello, world" in Python ðŸ˜†. Around that time, I also
              built my first computer. These were my first steps into the
              physical and logical world of computing, which turned me into a
              lifelong learner and enthusiast of the field.
